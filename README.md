# DosCalc

In the water treatment process, to treat the water, different types of chemicals like coagulants, flocculants, pH correction chemicals, chlorine solution etc are dosed. Often the commissioning engineers get confused with the calculations, arriving at the wrong quantity of chemical concentration to be prepared in the chemical tank, ultimately resulting in excess or underdosing of the chemical in the water to be treated. Hence there is a need for an easy calculator for the same. This program enables the user to simplify the process of arriving at the exact quantity of chemical required to be prepared in the chemical tank of a known volume of water for dilution. Provided we know the quantity of water in the chemical tank, the flowrate of metering pump, concentration of the chemical, amount to be dosed and the flowrate of water in the pipeline.
